# Task

    # Your friend has invited you to watch a tennis match at a local spoers
    # club. Since tennis isn't your favorite spoer, you get bored ridht at the
    # start of the first game and start looking for something to keep your self
    # enterntained. Noticing the scoreboard, you realize you don't even know
    # how many points have been won since the game started, so you decided to
    # calculate this number. Given the current score, your goal isto find the
    # number of points won in the current game.

    # If you are not familiar with tennis rules, here's a short description of
    # its scoring system. Score calling is unique in tennis: each point has a
    # corresponding call that is different from its point value. The table of
    # points won and corresponding calls is given below.

    # +----------------------+--------------------+
    # | Number of points won | Corresponding call |
    # +----------------------+--------------------+
    # |          0           |      "love"        |
    # +----------------------+--------------------+
    # |          1           |       "15"         |
    # +----------------------+--------------------+
    # |          2           |       "30"         |
    # +----------------------+--------------------+
    # |          3           |       "40"         |
    # +----------------------+--------------------+

    # There's an additional role to remember: when players are tied by one or
    # two points, the score is described as "15-all" and "30-all",
    # respectively.

    # It's guaranteed that no more then 5 points have been won so far, and the
    # gam is not over yet. It is also guaranteed that at least one point has
    # been won.

    # Input/Output
    # [input] string score
    # A string in the format <p1>-<p2> representing a valid score, where <p1> is
    # the first player's score.

    # [output] an integer


    # The number of points won so far. 

    # Example

    # For score = "15-40", the output should be 4. 
    # The first player won 1 point, and the second 3, so 1+3 = 4 points have
    # been on.

    # For score = "30-all", the output should be 4.
    # The players have won two points each.
